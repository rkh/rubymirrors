== A mirror API for Ruby

In [various][p1] [papers][p2] the advantages of having a mirror API to
separate reflection from a language implementation have been
discussed. This project aims at providing a number of specs and
classes that document a mirror API for Ruby. The mirror implementation
that is part of this project will use only those language facilities
that are available across Ruby implementations, the specs, however,
will also test behavior that cannot be provided in such a manner. The
idea here is, the in time all implementations provide their own
implementation of the mirror API, and all implementations collaborate
on this one spec.

Why do this, you ask? Because Ruby needs tools, and those tools need
to be written in Ruby. If they are not, that excludes many people from
tinkering with their tools, thus impeding innovation. You only have to
look at Emacs or Smalltalk to see what's possible when Programmers can
extend their tools, all tools, in a language they feel comfortable
in. If we have a standard mirror API, all tools that are written for
Ruby can be shared across implementations, while at the same time
allowing language implementers to use the facilities of their platform
to provide optimal reflective capabilities without tying them to
internals.
